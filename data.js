We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25 Joke's on you, we still alive Throw your hands up in the sky and say: We don't care what people say If this is your first time hearin' this You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man Flickin' Starter coats, man Man, you don't know, man We don't care what people say This is for my niggas outside all winter Cause this summer they ain't finna say: next summer I'm finna Sittin' in the hood like community colleges This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5 that still hustle Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55 And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up We put shit on layaway, then come back We claim other people kids on our income tax We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid And we don't care what people say Momma say she wanna move South Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house 'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work He figured he'd take work The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight But we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake And we don't care what people say You know the kids gon' act a fool When you stop the programs for after school And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic They favorite 50 Cent song 12 Questions We scream: rocks, blow, weed, park, see, now we smart We ain't retards, the way teachers thought Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class Sad enough we on welfare They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us But we don't care what people say My niggas"

And I can't even go to the grocery store Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team It seems we living the american dream But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem The prettiest people do the ugliest things For the road to riches and diamond rings We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us We trying to buy back our 40 acres And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe Oh when it all, it all falls down I'm telling you oh, it all falls down I say fuck the police, that's how I treat em We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em Things we buy to cover up what's inside Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth That's why shortys hollering where the ballas' at? Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack And a white man get paid off of all of that But I ain't even goin' act holier than thou Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou Before I had a house and I'd do it again Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific I got a problem with spending before I get it We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it Oh when it all, it all falls down I'm telling you oh, it all falls down Oh when it all, it all falls down I'm telling you oh, it all falls down"

Dipping through the streets\
Bumping R&B\
And I got to leave\
something to the 23's?\
And I do it (well well well well well)\
With my earth and the wind smoke a fire\
Let me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat\
Put you in a daze for maze\
Fullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex\
You ready for the world girl\
Come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me\
An every moment you controllin' me I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci\
And when I come over and bend your ass\
You be bumping Teddy Pendergrass\
I'd hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow\
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'm gonna finish last\
No matter how much of a thug you see\
I still spit it like it's R&B, so to the club with me\
And with some Luther come on and hope you finna and still be in love with me\
\
Baby drop another slow jam\
And all us lovers need hold hands\
And if you ain't got no man hop up in my Brougham\
I keep it pimping like an old man\
You got to roll with the plan\
Cause after that then I\
Take it to the dome\
Then I got to bone\
Stay up in the zone\
Got to get you home\
Gotta run up on\
And I do it (well well well well well)\
Baby drop another slow jam\
And all us lovers need hold hands\
And if you ain't got no man hop up on my brohem\
I keep it pimping like an old man\
You got to roll with the plan\
Cause after that then I\
Take you to my home\
And we could get it on\
Disconnect the phone\
Just to get you goin'\
Trying to make you moan\
And I do it (well well well well well)"

If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out\
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out\
Breathe in, breathe out\
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out\
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\
When I pull the piece out niggas like Peace out!\
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap\
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)\
But is it cool to rap about gold\
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)\
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack\
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack\
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant\
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again\
And it's still about the Benjamins\
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms\
Strippers named Cinnamon\
More chips than Pentium\
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is\
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks\
And I'm so broke I look back like Damn, was I on crack?\
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?\
What the hell was wrong with me dog?\
Sing along with my y'all\
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out\
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out\
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out\

If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\
When I pull the piece out niggas like Peace out!\
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick\
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick\
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this\
And givin' head is like a whale, using the toothpick\
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time\
Act now and get some action for $free.99\
Later on I might charge for ménage\
Heard her man was the boss of the floss\
But she still want to toss me the drawers\
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy\
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club\
And I'm still actin' calm than a mug\
She asked Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?\
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man\
Baby I fully understand\
Let me help you with a plan\
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga\
Give ME some head, that'll really piss I'm off\
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out\
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out\
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out\
Breathe in, breathe out\
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out\
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\
When I pull a piece out niggas like Peace out!\
I blow past low class niggas with no cash\
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask\
So when I go fast popo just laugh\
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash\
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst\
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon\
Pullin' up in the Lexuses/'lexeses, one on both hand\
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous\
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages\
K I need a free hand mammogram\
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam\
All of which is legal in Amsterdam\
So say my name like Candyman\
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman\
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave\
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe\
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out\
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out\
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out\
Breathe in, breathe out\
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out\
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\

picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him\
I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do\
I play the songs, he's like Who that spittin?\
I'm like It's me. He's like Oh, well okay.\
Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone\
going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats\
And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers\
cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with\
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID\
And No ID told him, look man, you wanna mess with Kanye\
you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\
[No ID:] Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\
I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not\
but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\
[Hiphop:] I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\
I'm like oh shit\
I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also\
People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production\
But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here\
So you know. After they picked that Truth beat\
I was figuring I was gonna do some more work\
But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago\
I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts\
just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy\
get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something\
or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\
I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample\
I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like oh, yo that shit is crazy\
Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty.\
And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me\
so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time\
and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like\
with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style\
when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'\
And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album\
I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound\
You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time\
I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with\
Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm\
sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did\
for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he\
gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I\
came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, oh\
you a real soulful dude [Jay-Z: you a real soulful dude]. And he\
uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got\
to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said\
[Jay-Z:] check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\
tell me what you think of this. And I heard it, and I was thinking\
like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't\
want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my\
personal opinion. So he asked me, what you think of it?\
[Jay-Z:] so what you thinkin?\
And I was like, man that shit tite,\
you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train\
man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just\
in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got\
acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like\
poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one\
of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through\
my production company, but he ended up going straight with the\
company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad\
news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at\
the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took\
that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about\
ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal\
with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to\
[Mother:] Come on, let's just go\
Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.\
I remember I pulled up\
[Mother:] Kanye, baby, we're here,\
I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a\
bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and\
the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'\
And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up\
there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I\
played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone\
he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at\
that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket\
hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said\
yo play that one beat for him. And I played 'Heart of the City.' And\
really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\
[Hiphop:] No I think Jay gon' like this one right here.\
And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that\
GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of\
them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen\
Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like yo what's up I'm Kanye.\
[Dame:] Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\
You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?\
Yo, this nigga got classics\
[Dame:] Jay got classics, G.\
You know I ain't talkin shit.\
I'm like oh shit. And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm\
still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show\
The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my\
eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all\
these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one\
thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be\
Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton\
sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John\
Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the\
time they was in the room, and I said, yo Jay I could rap. And I\
spit this rap that said, uh I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical\
shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips. And I saw his\
eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap\
was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.\
He said man that was tite.\
[Jay-Z:] That, that was cool. That was hot.\
That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.\
Okay, fast forward.\
So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just\
took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship\
with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my\
career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me\
to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at\
this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had\
relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so\
they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. Gimme a beat that sound\
like Jay-Z. You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them\
these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll\
be like, yo but I rap too. Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy\
'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever\
Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they\
didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked\
with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the\
company that'll say naw. Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my\
nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man\
[Jessica:] Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\
I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up\
Y'all niggaz is stupid. Let's just say I didn't get my deal.\
The nigga that was behind me, I mean,\
he wasn't even a nigga, you know?\
The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol\
Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.\
[Joe:] We gonna change the game, buddy.\
Dame was like, yo you got a deal with Capitol,\
okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\
[Dame:] you gotta make sure it's not wack.\
Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to\
play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and\
Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll\
never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\
I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\
I got eleven plaques on my walls right now\
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So\
I play that song for him, and he's like oh shit\
[Dame:] Oh shit it's not even wack.\
I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\
[Dame:] it's actually kinda hot.\
Like they still weren't looking at me\
like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole\
album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and\
save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's\
like yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick\
[Dame:] you don't wanna catch a brick\
You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\
I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, oh, word? Actually, even with\
that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was\
already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you\
know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I\
was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm\
not gonna name no names, but people told me, oh he's just a producer\
rapper and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--\
the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do\
man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio\
sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes\
man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said\
yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\
[Mel:] Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\
And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested\
and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying\
to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I\
called G, I said, man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?"

Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.\
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them,\
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.\
Let's take 'em back to the club.\
Least about an hour I would stand on line,\
I just wanted to dance.\
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.\
I just wanted to shine.\
Jay's favorite line: Dog, in due time\
Now he look at me, like Damn, dog, you where I am\
A hip hop legend.\

See back back then then if you had a car\
You were the Chi town version of Baby\

I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked\

The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm balling\
I'm leaning on a switch sitting crooked in my slab\
But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab\
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla\
Riding some candy coated crawling like a caterpillar\
I'm tipping on those 4's I'm jamming off this screw\
I'm looking for them hoes baby what it do?\
Drive slow homey\
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes\
Drive slow homey\
If you riding around the city with nowhere to go\

I got more TV's in here then where I live\
And it don't make no sense but baby I'm the shit\
And everything I flip you know is something serious\
I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims\
I got the baller genetics baby that's evident\
You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced\
That you should go and kiss it just a little bit\
I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain\
My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings\
They see me hoes acting like they seen a king\
With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green\
My wood grain oak I'm riding on vogues\
My cylinder quiet like tip toes\

This dark diction has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use it."

        lyrics:"I know it's past visiting hours\
But can I please give her these flowers\
The doctor dont wanna take procedures\
He claim my heart can't take the anastesia\
It'll send her body into a seizure\
The little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beeping,\
Hey chick, im at a lost for words\
What do you say at this time?\
Remember when I was nine?\
Tell her everything gone be fine?\
But i'd be lying, the family crying\
They want her to live, and she trying\
I'm argueing like what kind of doctor can we fly in\
You know the best medicine go to people thats paid,\
If Magic Johnson got a cure for A.I.D.S.\
And all the broke muthafuckers past away\
You tellin me if my grandma was in the N.B.A.\
Right now she'd be ok?\
But since she was just a secretary\
Working for the church\
For thirty five years\
Things sposed to stop right here\
My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong,\
Thats where I get my confidence from\
I asked the nurse did you do the research?\
She ask me, can you sign some t-shirts?\
Bitch is you smokin reefer?\
You dont see that we hurt\
But still..."

        lyrics: "I always knew that one day\
They'd try to bring me down\
Wow, one day, they tried to bring me down\
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down\
Down, way down\
We're going to mass today, we have to pray\
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say\
Since Pac passed away\
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me\
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything\
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream\
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is\
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids\
But they're gonna have to take my life 'fore they take my drive\
'cause when I was barely living, that's what kept me alive\
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time\
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind\
And get some lee way on the he say she say\
You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay\
Spanish girls say No hable inglés\
And everybody want to run to me for their single\
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help\
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself\
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself\
Dog, If I was you, I'd kill myself\
Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself\
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help\
Now I'll speak from the heart, you all fronting\
Everybody feel a way about K but at least you all feel something\
Why you come here, I bet it only it was forget to get you\
What kind of dream we found, see I'm often at your cross way\
forgetting it was that heaven let you. They tried to bring me down"

Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would\
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could\
But (You make me smile)\
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?\
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three\
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us\
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm on drugs\
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious\
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush\
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be, spontaneous\
Roll up the doge, henny and c-c-c-cola, then I'm co coming over\
Cuz its ne-never over\
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good\
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would\
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could\
But (You make me smile)\
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show\
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow\
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go\
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed\
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose\
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose\
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed\
Roll up the doge, henny and c-c-c-cola, and I keep co coming over\
Cuz its ne-never over\
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good\
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would\
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could\
But... (You Make Me Smile)\
(You make me smile with my heart)\
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good\
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would\
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could\
But... (You make me smile, With my heart)\
I just wanted to ask you\
Just wanted to um\
Let how would I put this uhh\
Let's say all your friends\
Remember the one\
You said if you ever she would be the one\
Ok, Ok, Ok (You make me smile with my heart)\
I was thinking, hypothetically\
I mean don't take this seriously\
Don't take me: I mean just\
Uhh not credibly\
I'm feeling incredibly\
I mean let it be\
Just let it be\
I mean you, her and me (You make me smile with my heart)\
I mean you, her and me\
Maybe, Baby, Baby\
You know I was just kidding\
Unless you gon' do it\
(You make me smile...)"
